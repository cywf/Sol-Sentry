# GPT-Functions Directory

This directory contains the configuration files for various functions that Sol-Sentry's AI assistant can perform. These JSON configuration files are used by the assistant to understand the context and parameters required for executing specific tasks related to blockchain security and analysis.

## Functions Overview

Each function file in this directory represents a distinct task that the Sol-Sentry AI can carry out. The assistant leverages these configurations to provide detailed, context-aware responses and analyses within its operational scope.

## List of Functions

- `analyze_contract_security.json`: Analyzes smart contracts for security vulnerabilities.
- `assess_permissioning.json`: Evaluates permissioning and access control lists in contracts.
- `audit_transaction_flow.json`: Audits the flow of transactions for any anomalies or inefficiencies.
- `check_gas_optimization.json`: Checks smart contracts for potential gas optimizations.
- `detect_reentrancy.json`: Detects reentrancy vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
- `evaluate_oracle_integrity.json`: Assesses the integrity and reliability of oracles used in contracts.
- `simulate_contract_behavior.json`: Simulates the behavior of smart contracts under various conditions.
- `test_smart_contract.json`: Runs tests on smart contracts to ensure they behave as expected.
- `validate_contract_compliance.json`: Validates smart contracts against regulatory and compliance standards.
- `verify_signature.json`: Verifies digital signatures to ensure authenticity and integrity.

## Usage

The assistant interacts with these configurations via the Sol-Sentry platform, which parses the function's parameters and provides the assistant with the necessary context for execution. Users can trigger these functions through the assistant's interface by referencing the specific task they need assistance with.
