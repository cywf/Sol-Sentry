# Unhandled Exception Contract for Sol-Sentry

## Overview

The `unhandled_exception` contract is crafted to demonstrate the unhandled exception vulnerability in smart contracts. This vulnerability occurs when an error or exception is not properly caught or managed within the contract, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior or security vulnerabilities.

## Structure

The directory structure for the `unhandled_exception` contract includes:

- `src/`: Contains the Rust source code specifically designed to mimic scenarios where an unhandled exception might occur.
- `Cargo.toml`: The Rust Cargo package manifest file, which outlines the package details and its dependencies.

## Usage

The `unhandled_exception` contract provides a way to understand the implications of unhandled exceptions in the contract's execution flow and their potential impacts.

### Testing Unhandled Exceptions

To test the `unhandled_exception` contract:

1. Navigate to the `unhandled_exception` contract's directory.
2. Build the contract using Cargo with the following command:

```bash
cargo build-bpf
```
Deploy the contract to a Solana blockchain environment (local or live) with the command:

```bash
solana program deploy /path/to/compiled/contract.so
```
Ensure to replace `/path/to/compiled/contract.so` with the correct path to your compiled contract.

Interact with the contract using Solana CLI tools or through a custom client to trigger and inspect the effects of unhandled exceptions.

## Contract Functions
- `trigger_exception`: This function simulates an operation that causes an exception which is not caught within the contract, illustrating what might happen in such cases.
- `verify_exception_handling`: Allows checking the contract's state and behavior following an exception, to understand how unhandled exceptions are dealt with.

## Exception Handling with Sol-Sentry
Sol-Sentry includes mechanisms for detecting unhandled exceptions and responding accordingly. Through its security features, Sol-Sentry can help prevent the adverse outcomes of such exceptions, like transaction reversals or alerting the contract owners and administrators.
