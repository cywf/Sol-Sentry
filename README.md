# Sol-Sentry

Welcome to the Sol-Sentry repository, a custom AI tool designed for enhancing the security and efficiency of Solana smart contract development. Sol-Sentry offers in-depth analysis, predictive threat modeling, and best practice recommendations to fortify your blockchain projects.

## Installation

To get started with Sol-Sentry, clone the repository and set up your environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cywf/Sol-Sentry.git
cd Sol-Sentry
```
Follow the setup instructions specific to your system

## Usage

Sol-Sentry is designed to be an intuitive tool for developers working with Solana's blockchain. Here's how to get started:

### Analyzing Your Smart Contracts

To analyze your smart contracts with Sol-Sentry, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
sol-sentry analyze <path-to-your-contract>
```
Replace <path-to-your-contract> with the path to the Solana program file you wish to analyze.

### Interpreting Analysis Reports
After running the analysis, Sol-Sentry will generate a report detailing potential vulnerabilities, performance optimizations, and security recommendations. The report will be saved in a specified output directory, which you can review to make informed decisions about your smart contract development.

### Continuous Integration
Sol-Sentry can also be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline. Here's an example using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Solana Smart Contract CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install Sol-Sentry
      run: |
        # Add installation commands here
    - name: Analyze Smart Contracts
      run: sol-sentry analyze src/program.rs
```
This setup will ensure that every push to the repository includes a Sol-Sentry analysis, keeping your codebase secure with every change.

### Advanced Usage
For advanced usage, Sol-Sentry supports various flags and options to tailor the analysis to your needs. For example, to exclude certain directories or files from the analysis, use the --exclude flag:

```bash
sol-sentry analyze src --exclude src/tests
```

### Using Sol-Sentry via ChatGPT

Sol-Sentry is accessible through ChatGPT, allowing for an interactive experience when analyzing your smart contracts. To get started, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Sol-Sentry ChatGPT page](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-6mhB4btQ0-sol-sentry).
2. Start a new chat session by describing the analysis or information you seek regarding your Solana smart contract.
3. Sol-Sentry will provide real-time feedback, analysis, and recommendations directly within the chat interface.

This method is ideal for quick checks and exploratory analysis without setting up a development environment.

### Using Sol-Sentry via the GPT Store

For a more integrated experience, Sol-Sentry can be accessed through the GPT store:

1. Visit the [GPT store](https://chat.openai.com/gpts) and search for Sol Sentry (created by Kylo Parisher).
2. Use the provided API to run analyses on your contracts programmatically. (WIP)
3. Incorporate the Sol-Sentry GPT API into your development tools for seamless integration.

Using Sol-Sentry via the GPT store allows for programmatic access to Sol-Sentry's capabilities, making it a versatile addition to your smart contract development toolkit.
